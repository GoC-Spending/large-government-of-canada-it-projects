## Combined Data

[Jump to the data](#list-of-government-of-canada-it-projects-over-1-million)

This data was collected in response to two written questions in the House of Commons, from June 2016 and May 2019. Each question asked federal government departments to report ongoing or planned IT projects over $1M.

These responses were collected in two sessional papers, [8555-421-266](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8555-421-266.pdf) and [8555-421-2460](https://large-government-of-canada-it-projects.github.io/pdf/8555-421-2460.pdf). Sessional papers are public information; they can be requested by [emailing the Library of Parliament](mailto:info@parl.gc.ca).

For each project, the data includes: 

*   Description
*   Total cost
*   Estimated completion date

### About the combined data

The table below incorporates both the [2016 data](/2016/) and the [2019 data](/2019). The 2016 data includes **398** projects and the 2019 data includes **463** projects. **98** projects appear in both datasets. 

For the 98 projects appearing in both, the combined data can be used to triangulate changes in project budget and timelines (“ahead of schedule”, “on schedule”, or “behind schedule”). Projects included only in the 2019 data are marked as “new”. Projects included only in the 2016 data are marked as “complete” if their estimated completion date was before May 1, 2019 (the benchmark date of the 2019 data), and as “unknown (past due)” if the estimated completion date was later but the project is not included in the 2019 data.
